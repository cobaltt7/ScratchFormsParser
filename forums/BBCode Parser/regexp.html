[quote][center][b][color=#1b4885]What Are Shops?[/b][/color][/center]
Have you ever wondered what's in the requests form? You click on it and you see a bunch of "shops"! Is that what you were expecting? Maybe or maybe not. I know it wasn't for me! A shop is a place where you can order anything from coding, art, banners, music, and more! Different shops offer different things. We offer everything. Now, the question I know you've been asking ever since you click on the "requests" link: the cost. It's all free here! In shops, you don't have to pay. In fact, there are specific rules against exchanging media for loves, favorites, follows, and etcetera. However, there are fake currencies some shops use for perks. We do not use them. We do everything for free! Just make sure to give credit, the order isn't too difficult, and the deadline is long enough for us to give you our perfect-as-pearls results. Not sure if our results are really as good as we say? We have a portfolio above, and many other shops have one too, so feel free to compare! Finally, you also join us and help make media for others! Just click on the "staff" link above![/quote]
